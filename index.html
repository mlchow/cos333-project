    <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
    <p>As a Princeton student, two major concerns are deciding on your concentration/certificates and combining your interests in several academic areas into fewer than 36 courses all while keeping track of your academic/degree progress. Although TigerHub shows you your major progress ONLY once you have selected a major, our product allows you to consider your degree progress in ANY potential major as soon as you have taken a prerequisite or departmental in that area.  Another new feature our application offers is a suggestion engine for your major or certificates based on the courses you take (and courses other similar students take).  These are potentially academic paths you may not have considered before but might want to!
    Our application better helps students consider and chart all options and possible pathways to a degree.  It also lets them understand what the courses they are taking are actually earning them (in terms of a degree, certificate, etc.).  Our product hopefully helps alleviate some confusion and brings clarity to how students can get the most out of their Princeton education.</p>
