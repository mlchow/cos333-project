    <h1>Progress Status</h1>
    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <ul><li>Allison Chang - archang@princeton.edu</li><li>Marisa Chow - mlchow@princeton.edu</li><li>Isabelle Ingato - iingato@princeton.edu</li><li>Andrew Kim - ak11@princeton.edu</li></ul>
    <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
    <p>Two major problems Princeton students face are deciding on their concentration/certificates and combining their interests in several academic areas into fewer than 36 courses all while keeping track of their academic progress.</p>
    <p>Although TigerHub shows you your degree progress (ONLY) once you have selected a major, our product allows you to consider your degree progress in ANY potential major as soon as you have taken a prerequisite or departmental in that area.  Another new feature our application offers is a suggestion engine for your major or certificates based on the courses you take (and courses other similar students take).  These are potentially academic paths you may not have considered before but might want to!</p>
    <p>Our application better helps students consider and chart all options and possible pathways to a degree.  It also lets them understand what the courses they are taking are actually earning them (in terms of a degree, certificate, etc.).  Our product hopefully helps alleviate some confusion and brings clarity to how students can get the most out of their Princeton education.</p>
